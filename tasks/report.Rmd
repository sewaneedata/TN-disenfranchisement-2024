# Executive Summary
The purpose of this report is to give the client in-depth insight into the various processes we went through while creating this project. This report will cover our purpose for this research project, the methods we used, what we did with the data, the data analysis, key findings, figures, and what we've concluded from all the data we've compiled. With our findings, we will be able to help many with the task of combating disenfranchisement. 

# Introduction

An estimated 450,000 to 470,000 individuals in TN are being denied their right to vote due to incarceration (Uggen, Larson, Shannon, and Stewart, 2022), disproportionately affecting African American voters (King and Erickson, 2016; Daniels, 2020; Betts-Gaston, 2022; Manza and Uggen, 2004; Blain, 2003). Research on felony disenfranchisement frequently explores who is affected, the reasons why people are affected, and the implications of disenfranchisement laws regarding discussions on legislature, policy, race and marginalization, historical context, incarceration, and violations of rights. However, there are many gaps in related literature that fail to quantify how felony disenfranchisement impacts elections, especially by location. This project seeks to fill in some of these gaps by investigating how many individuals are disenfranchised, specifically in each county in the state of Tennessee. 

# Methods
### Data Acquisition
There is no standardized tracking system in place that houses county-level data on the number of disenfranchised individuals who are eligible to restore their voting rights. To circumvent this roadblock, we obtained an estimate of the number of people impacted by county and how it affects local elections by scouring the internet. We performed web scraping, data cleaning, and data exploration to obtain the appropriate datasets.

### Data Provenance
The data we compiled comes from the following sources:

**2019 Crime Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI):**  
This dataset provides information on crime rates and types of crimes reported across different regions, which is essential for understanding the context of criminal justice and its implications on disenfranchisement.

**2022 Election Data from the Secretary of State:**   
This dataset includes election-related data such as voter turnout, election results, and voter registration statistics. It helps in analyzing the electoral process and its outcomes, especially in relation to disenfranchisement.

**Original Data on County Parties from the County Mayor’s Office:**  
This dataset is an original dataset that we created to include political party affiliations of county leadership in each county in Tennessee. It aids in understanding the political landscape and partisan dynamics affecting disenfranchisement.

**2022 State and Countywide Incarceration Data from the TN Department of Corrections:**  
This dataset contains information on the number of individuals incarcerated for a felony conviction at state and county levels in Tennessee. It is crucial for analyzing the impact of incarceration rates on disenfranchisement.

**2022 Demographic Data from the Census:**  
This dataset provides demographic information such as population demographics, socioeconomic status, and racial demographics. It helps in understanding the demographic composition of areas affected by disenfranchisement.

### Dataset Merging
We merged the aforementioned datasets to create original ones, enabling us to approach our question from a fresh perspective beyond providing a single numerical answer. Specifically, we merged the voter turnout data with the census data to analyze what demographics might influence voter turnout by county. We also analyzed the relationships between incarceration rates, demographic factors, election outcomes, and disenfranchisement across counties in Tennessee. This integration allows for a comprehensive analysis that considers demographic profiles, crime rates, and the impact of incarceration on voting rights across different counties in Tennessee.

# Analysis
We built the Tennessee county map (see Figure 1) to illustrate the patterns in the voter turnout and compare with the demographics of each county. Then, we charted the incarceration rate by felony type (see Figure 2) to get an estimate of the ratio of individuals who have the possibility of restoring their rights upon release versus those who do not. 

Figure 1. 
![Voter Turnout](Rplot05.jpeg)


This plot shows voter turnout rates. As you can see, the percentage only goes up to 50%. This is because Tennessee has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the U.S. ().

Figure 2.

To obtain Figure 2, we used data from the 2022 Tennessee Department of Corrections on the currently incarcerated population by felony type. One of the most immediately apparent observations from Figure 2 is that 101,666 people convicted of a felony are not due to violent crimes. Therefore, 101,666 could have their rights restored upon release were it not for the convoluted rights restoration process, which includes paying off one's legal financial obligations (LFOs) and restoring one's gun rights (according to the recent Falls v. Goins case).

Based on the offense type of currently incarcerated individuals with felony convictions, Figure 3 estimates which counties would gain the most potential votes. As a reminder, the actual number of potential votes to be gained is much greater due to the fact that about 3/4 of disenfranchised individuals have already served their time. 

Figure 4.

Using the data from the 2022 Tennessee Department of Corrections and building off of Uggen, Larson, Shannon, and Stewart's (2022) approximation of individuals across Tennessee who are currently post-release, we also estimated the statewide number of individuals who have already been released from incarceration but are still disenfranchised. Figure 4 shows the estimated amount of disenfranchised people across the state either due to violent crimes () or non-violent crimes (). 


Figure 5.
![Measuring Correlation Coefficient Value](prop_aa_pop_vt.jpeg){width=400%}

Figure 5 shows that in the state of Tennessee, voter turnout by county varies from 29.3% to 48.4% and does not depend in a statistically significant way on the African American population or income level. On the other hand, it is important to note that very few counties have an African American population over ~20%. Although the African American Tennesseans make up only 17% of the state’s population, 40% of them are state prisoners. Additionally, the bar chart above visualizes that there are currently around 100,000 people incarcerated for felonies in the state of TN; the rest of the disenfranchised population have already served their time and have been released.

# Key Observations
We found that there are 110,000 individuals currently incarcerated, while an estimated 300,000 individuals have been released from prison and may be eligible to regain their right to vote. There is a direct relationship between counties with high incarceration rates and low voter turnout. Counties with high incarceration rates have never exceeded 50 percent in voter turnout, contributing to Tennessee having the lowest voter turnout in the country.

# Conclusion
Although the data on disenfranchisement is bare, the impact of our research is substantial because it fills the gap in the literature on disenfranchisement. 

Admittedly, there are limitations to any argument. Due to the lack of systemic tracking of data on formerly and contemporarily incarcerated individuals, our research has a few caveats. First, we do not know if the Tennessee Department of Corrections  data on felon incarceration by county is categorized by the location one is convicted, their street address, or where they are imprisoned. Second, to determine the estimate of possible voters by county, we took a state-wide proportion and generalized it to all counties, which is a rough estimate not necessarily true to reality. Even so, we found that voter disenfranchisement is not discussed enough nor tracked enough. The findings will aid in raising awareness of the issue and the importance of thorough data collection. Additionally, our study highlights the disproportionate impact of disfranchisement on minority communities due to lack of representation by elected officials.

Our work will be used to aid Dr. Franklin, Free Hearts, and the Free the Vote Coalition in their efforts to combat voter disenfranchisement in Tennessee. Our findings will be used in legislative proposals and provided to county governments to underscore the political significance of this issue. Finally, our research serves as academically informed advocacy for legislation to be put in place that leverages votes in support of a new voter enfranchisement/restoration law.
